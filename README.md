# MegAmi's Sonic Mania Decompilation Mods
Here you can find the source code to all of my Sonic Mania mods using the [RSDKv5(U) Decompilation](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/RSDKv5-Decompilation)'s [GameAPI](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/GameAPI). Check [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md) for a building guide.

All code found here is intended to be used as reference material, but feel free to modify the code for personal use if you wish. Please ask me on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/members/1487155) or Discord (MegAmi#2810) if you wish to use code from one of these mods in your own project.
